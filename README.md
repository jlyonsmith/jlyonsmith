- 👋 Hi, I’m @jlyonsmith
- 👀 I mostly program in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) languages
- 🚧 The frameworks I reach for most often are [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
- 💔 I think [Bun](https://bun.com/) is an underrated tool.
- 🛠️ My favorite new tool at the moment is the [Zed](https://zed.dev/) editor
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to effectively use the [ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/) and [FlatBuffer](https://flatbuffers.dev/) message packing tools.
- 💞️ I'm happy to collaborate a little on the open source projects that I use
