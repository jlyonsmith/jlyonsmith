- 👋 Hi, I’m @jlyonsmith
- 👀 I mostly program in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) languages
- 🚧 The frameworks I reach for most often are [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- 💔 I think [Deno](https://deno.com/) is an underrated tool
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the [NATS](https://nats.io/) messaging system
- 💞️ I'm happy to collaborate a little on the open source projects that I use
- 📫 Reach me at [lyon-smith.org](https://lyon-smith.org)
